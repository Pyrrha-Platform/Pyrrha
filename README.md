# ![Prometeo](/img/prometeo.png?raw=true)

In the face of natural disasters, such as wildfires, Pyrrha protects those who protect us - the firefighters. With our solution, we've developed a prototype sensor which sends environmental telemetry (temperature, humidity, and smoke concentration). This data is processed by a machine learning algorithm which is able to predict firefighter health, indicating if they are OK, soon to be in danger, or in danger. The goal is to track real-time status, and eventually use aggregated data to make suggestions that improve health outcomes in the long run.

## Pyrrha Platform V1 (based on Prometeo v3)

The first version of the Pyrrha Platform (based on Prometeo version 3) is nearing completion, and will soon be a Call for CodeÂ® with The Linux Foundation project. The project will carry on as a separate name distinct from the Prometeo trademark, Pyrrha, who is the daughter-in-law of Prometheus in Greek mythology.
